## Overview
In this Project, we are going to build a movie recommendation system using three way, Popularity based recommendation system, Content based recommendation system, Collaborative filtering based recommendation system.
The dataset we are going to use is the Movie dataset from Kaggle which contains about 4803 rows and 24 features. and in this dataset we have movies only upto 2017, So I also collected 2018, 2019, 2020 movies data from wikipedia.
